# Golden-age-of-Video-Games

Case study project.
This notebook is a task from the DataCamp platform uploaded to demonstrate my skills in working with SQL queries.
In this project, I explored the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. I compared a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

Original project on DataCamp platform you can find [by the link](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1413).

## What skills are shown here:
- aggregation functions;
- joins;
- subqueries.


## What was done
1. Show the top-10 selling video games of all time.
2. Count number of records without reviews. 
3. Count average critic and users scores for years and write it in descending order (given the number of released games).
4. Count total sales for top years. 

## For the future analysis: 
- Best years for developers;
- Find data about genre and find liders for each genre;
- Popularity of genres for years;
